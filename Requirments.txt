1.	Manual assumes you already have user in AWS and Rekognition service.
2.	Install flask + activate virtual machine from here: 
	http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/ 
	Run it.
3.	Make sure you have python 2.7 and up on the virtual machine.
4.	With pip install in virtual environment:
	- Install beautifulsoup (for FB html parsing)
	- Install boto3 (AWS – Rekognition API)
	- Install OpenCV2 with following steps:
5.	On windows:
	From virtual environment: 
	pip install opencv-python
	- On RaspberryPi3 (Raspbian):
	There is no install file for RP3, therefore it is required to download opencv libraries, and then compile and install them, the process takes approximately 2-3 hours. Follow the instructions from here:
	https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/18/install-guide-raspberry-pi-3-raspbian-jessie-opencv-3/
6.	Enter the following environment parameters to virtual machine with your values:
	- export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
	- export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_value>

sudo timedatectl set-time '2018-11-05 15:58'
It is strongly advised to use Ethernet cable and not WiFi.

In case you want to run with raspberry camera:
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2
But note it might not work with Javascript
